## Part 1:
 - [ ] Translate into English: (M → H)∧(S →C)
 ```
If mathematics is easy then the homework is done and if it is sunny then camping is fun.
```
- [ ] Translate into Propositional Logic: “Mathematics is easy or camping is fun, as long as it is sunny and the homework is done.”
```
(S ^ H) -> (M v C)
```
## Part 2:
- [ ] Use a truth table to determine whether this is a tautology, contradiction, or neither:  (¬B → ¬A) → ((¬B → A) → B)
```
| A | B | ¬A | ¬B | ¬B -> ¬A | ¬B -> A | ((¬B -> A) -> B
|---|---|--- |--- | -------- | ------- | ---------------
| T | T | F  | F  | T        |         |
| T | F | F  | T  | F        |         |
| F | T | T  | F  | T        |         |
| F | F | T  | T  | T        |         |
```
